# Vertex Cover Simulator (Brute Force)

## ðŸŽ¯ What It Does
Simulates the brute-force approach to the Vertex Cover problem on small graphs.

## âœ… How to Use
1. Enter number of vertices (e.g. 4)
2. Enter edges as pairs (e.g. `0 1`, `1 2`)
3. Click "Find Minimum Vertex Cover"
4. The minimum cover will be displayed and nodes highlighted in the graph

## ðŸ“Œ Limitations
- Works best for small graphs (â‰¤ 10 nodes)
